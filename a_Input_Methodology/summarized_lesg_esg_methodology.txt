Refinitiv ESG Score Interpretation Framework (Condensed for Modeling Use)
To approximate the qualitative meaning of numerical ESG scores from Refinitiv (LSEG), the
following banding structure is employed based on alignment with the materiality-weighted,
indicator-driven scoring methodology:
• 80–100: Highly comprehensive ESG disclosure across environmental, social, and
governance pillars; evidence of quantified targets, third-party assurance, and
alignment with sector-specific materiality metrics.
• 60–79: Robust ESG reporting with structured policies and performance indicators;
partial assurance and some gaps in scope or depth relative to sector norms.
• 40–59: General ESG references are present, but disclosures lack quantification,
specificity, or external validation.
• 20–39: ESG content is limited in relevance or substance, with generic language and
low coverage of material indicators.
• 0–19: No substantive ESG reporting identifiable.
These bands are not officially published by Refinitiv but represent a derived interpretive
structure informed by their percentile-based scoring methodology, which integrates sector-
adjusted materiality weightings and controversy overlays
