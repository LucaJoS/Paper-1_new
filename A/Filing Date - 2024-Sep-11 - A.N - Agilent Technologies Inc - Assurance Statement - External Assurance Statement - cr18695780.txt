RE: 2023 Assurance Statement
Hi Apoorva:
Below please find DEKRA Certification’s assurance statement for the 2023 supplier audits.
This statement attests that DEKRA Certification can provide reasonable assurance the
claims regarding environmental, health, safety, and social responsibility (EHS&SR), as
they relate to identified suppliers by Agilent Technologies. In 2023 DEKRA performed
global audits of Agilent-identified suppliers. These suppliers were found to be in
compliance with, or have provided corrective action plans to become compliant with,
Agilent’s stated EHS&SR program, including but not limited to: policies regarding worker
safety, environmental safety, Ozone Depleting Compounds (ODC), and policies that
strictly forbid and prevent any and all acts of human trafficking or slavery as those terms
are used in the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010, California Civil
Code, section 1714.43.
Best regards,
Kevin J. Campbell
