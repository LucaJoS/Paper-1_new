CBRE AGILENT | MATERIALITY ASSESSMENT RESULTSMATERIALITY MATRIX OVERVIEW
• According to GRI, reporters are required to apply the Materiality
Principle, which states that material topics must be identified based
on the two dimensions of the Principle:
1. Reflect the reporting organisation’s significant economic,
environmental, and social impacts; and/or
2. Substantively influence the assessments and decisions of
stakeholders
• The X axis of the materiality matrix indicates the relative
significance of topics identified under the first dimension of the
Materiality Principle
• The Y axis of the materiality matrix indicates the degree to which
each impact influences the assessments and decisions of
stakeholders about Agilent (second dimension of the Materiality
Principle)

CBRE AGILENT | MATERIALITY ASSESSMENT RESULTSSUMMARY AND NEXT STEPS
• The final list of material topics, including sub-topics & GRI Standards that link to each topic, has been provided to Agilent
• The results from the final matrix are to be included in the upcoming Corporate Responsibility Report to help inform the
contents of the publication
• Note that Agilent has the option to display a ‘full’ matrix showing lower sections that are empty and are not currently
displayed
• CBRE will map the list of identified material topics against the the UN Sustainable Development Goals to help Agilent
determine the key Goals it contributes to
• CBRE will provide a materiality assessment methodology document and working files to Agilent, as well as feedback on
opportunities to improve future materiality assessments
