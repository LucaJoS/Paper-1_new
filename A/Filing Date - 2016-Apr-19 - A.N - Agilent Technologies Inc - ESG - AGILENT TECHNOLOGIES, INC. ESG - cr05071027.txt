5A LEADER IN
CORPORATE
C ITIZENSHIP
Outstanding corporate citizenship has three main
c omponents, and all are important priorities for Agilent.
The first element is corporate governance - the practices
that bring to life the highest standards of integrity and
transparency. Our uncompromising integrity is core in all
our dealings with customers and suppliers.
The second element of corporate citizenship is the role we
play as an employer and community member. Our
corporate citizenship efforts strengthen Agilent’s long-
term competitiveness and help improve the viability of our
many communities. We will continue to make these
efforts a priority. The third component is a dedicated focus
on sustainability in our products and operations. As a
result, Agilent strives to honor our obligations to society
by being an economic, intellectual, social, and
