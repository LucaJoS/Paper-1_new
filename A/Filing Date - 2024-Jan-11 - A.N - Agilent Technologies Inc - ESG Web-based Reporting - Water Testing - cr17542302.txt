Water Testing
Comprehensive Monitoring of a Vital Resource
Growing population, climate change, and industrial contamination are some of the issues that cause
water stress and impact water quality. Analytical testing to ensure water quality and safety is essential
for health and the ecosystem. Comprehensive water testing includes analysis of regulated pollutants
like pesticides, semi-volatile organic compounds, metals, disinfection byproducts, and emerging
contaminants like PFAS, hormones, and many unknown chemicals. For over 45 years, Agilent has been
a market leader in providing complete solutions for water quality testing and analysis including sample
preparation, consumables, instrumentation, and expert training.
