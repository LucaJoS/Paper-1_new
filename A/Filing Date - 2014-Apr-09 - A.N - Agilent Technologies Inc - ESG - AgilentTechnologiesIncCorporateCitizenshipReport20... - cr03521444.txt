CORPORATE
CITIzENShIP
Outstanding corporate citizenship has three main
components, and all are important priorities for Agilent.
The first element is corporate governance—the practices
that bring to life the highest standards of integrity and
transparency. Our uncompromising integrity is core in all
our dealings with customers and suppliers.
The second element of corporate citizenship is the role
we play as an employer and community member. Our
corporate citizenship efforts strengthen Agilent’s long-
term competitiveness and help improve the viability of
our many communities. We will continue to make these
efforts a priority. The third component is a dedicated
focus on sustainability in our products and operations.
As a result, Agilent strives to honor our obligations to

energy efficiency in several product lines. most of the
energy savings are due to two key factors:
• The increased type and volume of tests that can
