Agilent Global Anti‐Corruption Policy Summary
Agilent does business directly or indirectly in over 120 countries around the globe,
each of which has its own unique laws, customs, and business practices. Agilent
requires its employees and business partners in all geographies to conduct their
affairs with uncompromising integrity and will not tolerate corrupt activities of
any kind.
Agilent maintains a written policy against corruption that prohibits promising,
offering, or giving to, or receiving from, any individual anything of value or
personal benefit with the expectation of receiving a favor, a grant of business, or
any other business advantage in return. Such actions are sometimes referred to
as bribes, kickbacks, or improper quid pro quos.
Agilent is committed to complying with:
1. The laws and regulations of each country where Agilent conducts business;
2. The laws and regulations of the United States, including the Foreign Corrupt
Practices Act;
3. Other international anti‐corruption laws and regulations, including the U.K.
Bribery Act of 2010 and the OECD Anti‐Bribery Convention, to which 38
countries are signatories;
4. Agilent’s policies and procedures; and
5. Agilent’s Standards of Business Conduct
Agilent’s anti‐corruption policy incorporates the common elements of anti‐
corruption laws and regulations worldwide that apply to Agilent’s business.
Agilent managers are responsible for promoting awareness of and enforcing
compliance with the policy among their reports at all levels and must not actively
or passively authorize or ignore corrupt activities in their organization. Employees
who violate the policy will be subject to disciplinary action, which may include
termination of employment. No employee will suffer adverse consequences for
refusing to offer or make a corrupt payment even if it may result in the loss of
business.
