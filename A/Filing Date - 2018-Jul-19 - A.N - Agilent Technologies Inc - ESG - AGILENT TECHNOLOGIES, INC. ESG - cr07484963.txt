67Our Mission: To Improve The Human Condition
Letter from Our CEO
Agilent teams are passionate about providing our customers
with trusted answers to complex challenges. Whether we are
helping our customers keep food supplies safe; reducing air,
water or soil pollution; or fighting cancer with new more
personalized diagnostics and therapeutics, we know that
together with our customers, we are m aking a tangible
difference in the lives of people around the world. In fact,
our mission is “to improve the human condition.”
Our commitment extends to how we achieve our business
goals. All of our decisions are deeply rooted in our values,
which to us, means doing the right thing for customers, employees and the planet. We set clear
metrics and we work to continuously improve.
We Create Sustainable Products and Solutions
Nearly 85 percent of the laboratories we serve have told us they have sustainability goals in place. We support them
through product innovations that not only meet strict international standards, but also take less space, use less energy
and water, and produce lower emissions. Over the past year, we introduced game-changing products that help meet
those goals, and we are committed to annual R&D investments to ensure further progress. We are also expanding our
green logistics to reduce shipping and packaging.
We Operate with Environmental Responsibility Everywhere in the World
We challenge ourselves with increasingly tougher goals for our operations. We are making major investments to
reduce the amount of power we consume and waste we discard, and we are beginning to see strong results. We
continue to make progress toward our goal of diverting 95 percent of solid waste from landfills by 2020. We replaced
traditional lighting with LEDs in sites around the world, resulting in about 40 percent greater energy efficiency. We have
also invested in innovative lower-carbon electricity generation systems at our largest U.S. sites, and expect an estimated
25 percent reduction in carbon dioxide compared to the less efficient coal and gas power generators. And we beat our
goal of six percent water consumption reduction worldwide to achieve a nine percent reduction.We Embrace a Culture of Diversity and Inclusion
Agilent is a truly global company with customers in more than 110 countries. We value the cultural diversity of our
customers, our partners and our teams. A wide variety of perspectives yields richer results and benefits all of us. While
diversity and inclusion are part of our culture, we created a formal program in 2017, which I believe will ensure focus
across the company in this important area. We know that diversity and inclusion are key drivers of innovation, superior
business results, and making Agilent an even greater place to work.
We Invest in Employees and Communities
Citizenship commitments aren’t only company-level initiatives. Agilent employees are incredibly generous. They
contributed to 600 nonprofits last year, matched by the Agilent Technologies Foundation. We also support our
employees in sharing of their time and talent in community volunteer activities by providing them with up to one full
week per year paid time off to do so. Last year many employees took advantage of our Volunteer Time Off policy, even
combining this benefit with their personal vacations to support volunteer projects around the world. I am inspired by
their personal stories.
In 2017, we established the Agilent Employee Assistance Fund, which allows employees to contribute to funds for their
fellow employees or to apply to receive funds if affected by a natural disaster. We continue to support programs that
give students, from middle school through university, new education opportunities, particularly supporting programs
that encourage girls to pursue careers in the sciences. We help bring science to life through hands-on experiments that
our volunteers conduct with students everywhere from local libraries to the largest science museums in the world, and
we provide hundreds of teacher development opportunities.
Agilent is a leader in our industry. We take our leadership position seriously. And we believe that is our responsibility to
help build a safer, more sustainable world and improve the human condition. It is our mission and the foundation of our
culture.
The following report details our progress and outlines some of the high expectations we have for ourselves.
We w elcome your interest, feedback and partnership as we work to improve the human condition.
Mike McMullen

10Agilent Sustainability Statement
We are committed to sustainability and contribute through our own operations and innovative
technologies that enable our customers to address complex global issues. Our mission is to
“improve the human condition” and we believe sustainability is an important part of meeting
our mission. All of our actions are based on our long-standing values, and achieved with
uncompromising integrity. Our culture includes respect for the contributions of every employee
in our global workforce. We support the communities in which we live and work, and encourage
employees to share their time and talents in their communities.

We create sustainable products and solutions that meet
increasingly strict international standards and help customers
meet their sustainability goals by using less energy and water,
producing lower emissions and requiring less space.Sustainability Through Innovation
Agilent is committed to innovation over the long term. Research & Development is such a high
priority that every year we invest at least eight cents on every dollar of revenue into R&D in our
businesses and central research labs. We look beyond the evolution of our current products
and platforms to create the technologies and applications that will become the foundation for
tomorrow’s successes in helping our customers’ meet their challenges. This includes helping
them meet sustainability goals in their own laboratories.
Some examples include innovations to reduce the energy consumption of new products such as
our industry-changing Intuvo 9000 gas chromatograph and our IDP dry scroll pumps which are
oil-free and used in applications such as mass spectrometry which require low pressure vacuum
technology. Our Ultivo Triple Quadrupole LC/MS is 70 percent smaller than its predecessor, and
correspondingly uses less energy. The 4210 MP-AES is both more sustainable and safer than
traditional atomic absorption for multi-element analysis as it runs on air instead of flammable
gases. Sustainability is very much a driver in our innovation processes and it is an important part of
our mission of “improving the human condition.”
Darlene Solomon, Ph.D.
Agilent Senior Vice President and Chief Technology Officer
Intuvo 9000 Gas Chromatograph System
• Uses an efficient direct heating system that requires less than half the
electrical power of a conventional GC.
• Takes up about half the bench space of a conventional air-bath oven GC.
• Ferrule-free direct connections with plug-and-play flow path components
eliminate a major source of maintenance and complexity.
• Disposable Guard Chip eliminates the need for cumbersome column
trimming.
13Sustainability Through Innovation
IDP Dry Scroll Pumps
• Oil free vacuum pumps for Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry are
clean, green and affordable, and completely remove the need to use any
oil in the analytical process.
• Eliminates the risk of hydrocarbon contamination in the vacuum system.
• Closed system from inlet to exhaust (particularly well suited for rare gas
and helium recirculation applications) reduces toxic gas emissions.
Ultivo Triple Quadrupole Liquid Chromatograph/Mass Spectrometer
• Reduces space requirements, as it is the smallest footprint of any Liquid
Chromatograph/Triple Quadrupole on the market-price performance
per square foot ratio leading to reduced costs and fastest path to
achieving return on investment.
• VacShield vacuum provides vent-less ion injector exchange capabilities
that reduce wear and tear and facilitates rapid front-end maintenance.
4210 MP-AES
• Reduces water consumption as the system does not use any water to
analyze samples; runs on air instead of combustible gases.
• Improves laboratory safety – in addition to eliminating flammable and
oxidizing gases, the MP-AES eliminates the need to plumb multiple gases
into the laboratory, or manually transport and handle gas cylinders.
• Runs unattended without flammable or expensive gas supply,
dramatically reducing operating costs.
1415Operations
Environmental responsibility is a fundamental part of how we
operate. We are making major investments to reduce power
consumption and waste – and we’re beating our own goals to
cut water use worldwide.Sustainability Strategy
Agilent’s approach to sustainability is multi-faceted and is an integral part of our instrument and
solution design, how we operate our facilities, supplier selection, and most important, how we
treat our employees. We set metrics for ourselves and measure our progress on a regular basis.
Our sustainability strategy includes:
Products
• Ensuring our products meet or exceed their published specifications.
• Ensuring our products comply with safety and environmental standards
and regulations.
• Innovating to increase the sustainability of the products and solutions we
offer our customers.
Our Operations
• Investing in and driving continuous improvement in environmental
sustainability through recycling, conservation of resources, prevention
of pollution, product development and promotion of environmental
responsibility among our employees.

17In 2017, Agilent completed key energy-saving installation
projects at our sites in Denmark, Germany, Italy, the U.S.,
China and Singapore.
A key component of the projects was the replacement
of traditional lighting with LEDs, which are typically
about 40 percent more energy efficient than traditional
fluorescent lights.
These projects will reduce annual electricity consumption
by about 6,000 MWh, which is equivalent to a reduction
of over 3,000 tons of carbon dioxide produced every year.
These $3.8 million energy-saving investments will also
save Agilent about $1.1 million annually.Operations Policies
Supplier Code of Conduct Policy
Our Supplier Code of Conduct Policy states that we will not establish
or maintain a business relationship with a supplier if we believe that its
practices violate local laws or basic international principles relating to human

Strengthening Dairy Safety in China
When Agilent learned that there were few, if any, specific
safety standards for dairy products in China, and children
were suffering from milk-borne illness, the Agilent Foundation
partnered with the China Dairy Association to create a training
and testing lab for about 500 dairies in China. Since the initial
project began, the country now has adopted major safety
standards that are some of the strictest in the world.

G4-14 Precautionary Approach or Principle Addressed by the Organization
Agilent Enterprise Risk Management
The Agilent Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) program provides a framework for
identifying material risks across the company, determining ownership of the risk,
supporting the creation and maintenance of business continuity plan. It ensures the
adequacy of plans across key business flows, appropriate testing/drills and the
availability of a central repository for documentation.
The ERM program is managed within Agilent’s Global Infrastructure Services
organization. Oversight is provided by the Executive Risk Committee, comprised of
the CEO staff, which meets twice per year to review progress, evaluate present and
emerging risks, and validate the program that has identified the correct principal risk
area to focus on.
Product Environmental Management
Agilent aims to minimize environmental impact of our products and their packaging.
We are committed to conforming with applicable regulations related to the Restricted
Substances in Products. When a customer decides no longer need a product,
Agilent will take it back for reuse or ensure it is properly recycled. For more information
go to Agilent's Product Take-Back program. In addition, we use tools such as the
General Specification for the Environment and our Design for the Environment
Guidelines to help minimize the environmental impacts of product packaging.
Agilent's Materials Declaration Requirements
Agilent requires hazardous and restricted material composition data for the
purchased materials used in Agilent's products, including parts procured on Agilent's
behalf by third parties, such as contract manufacturers, distributors, and third-party
logistics suppliers.
To meet the various requirements of our customers and product chemical content
restrictions imposed by numerous country laws and regulations, Agilent must maintain
material composition data on hazardous substances.
Agilent requests data about regulated hazardous substance content of materials in
order to trade in legal compliance worldwide - we do not ask suppliers about other,
non-regulated substances. Agilent's General Specification for the Environment (GSE)
consolidates all material restrictions into one document, which covers environmental
laws in the Americas, Asia-Pacific and Europe.
36Agilent's Materials Declaration Requirements sets forth materials and substances that
must be reported to Agilent on a general basis. It not only includes a list of banned
substances, but also defines the process for completing the report and returning the
information to Agilent.
Chemical Management
Agilent actively manages its chemical use in all operations and strict controls and
procedures are in place to minimize any potential risks. All new chemicals, for
example, must be pre-approved by competent staff before they can be purchased and
used. Agilent also has policies in place to prohibit or restrict the use of certain
particularly hazardous chemicals such as carcinogenic, mutagenic or reprotoxic
substances. Chemical safety related information and mandated training is available
to everyone who may use or come into contact with potentially hazardous substances.
All site chemical operations are subject to regular audit and inspection as part of
Agilent’s Environmental, Health and Safety Management System.

G4-25 Basis for Identification and Selection of Stakeholders with Whom to Engage
Agilent engages with a wide range of stakeholders on issues that affect the company’s
operations. During business planning, Agilent considers external charters, principles,
and guidelines. We also participate in industry and trade groups at local, regional, state,
national, and international levels to address emerging issues; develop industry-wide
approaches to environmental and social challenges; and cooperate with governments,
non-governmental organizations and other stakeholders on common concerns.
G4-26 Approaches to Stakeholder Engagement
Agilent engages with our stakeholders through consultation, surveys, ad-hoc feedback
and reviews:
• The Agilent Customer Satisfaction Survey gathers feedback from customers on
their experience interacting with Agilent through its representatives and website
and also with using Agilent’s products and software. Feedback from these surveys
is acted upon in a number of ways. Customers who have expressed dissatisfaction
with an aspect of their Agilent experience in their survey response score are quickly
contacted to address the issue. Customer suggestions and feedback are also used
as inputs into customer experience and product improvement projects. Recent
improvements, for example, include a redesign of the Agilent website that resulted
in significantly improved satisfaction scores around the world.
48• The Agilent Leadership Survey is a semiannual survey that allows Agilent employees
to provide feedback on leadership effectiveness. The Leadership Survey is focused
on critical leadership practices that are central to executing Agilent’s business
results. Audit results are compared with external best-in-class benchmarks to
ensure we are performing at the top in our industry.
• We have ongoing relationships with local, regional, and national regulators
regarding operational areas such as Environmental Health and Safety (EHS),
employee engagement and labor compliance, product environmental and safety

50G4-27 Key Topics and Concerns Raised Through Stakeholder Engagement
Stakeholder feedback mechanisms combine to provide Agilent with information to help
improve our economic, environmental and social performance. For example, Agilent
Quality reviews the questionnaires and our scores from socially responsible investment
indices, to identify areas where we could further improve our performance. Similarly,
Agilent Public Affairs uses the inputs it receives to guide our community programs,
such as volunteerism and grants and Human Resources uses feedback from the
employee surveys to review and modify company programs and benefits.
Agilent management routinely meets with shareholders and prospective shareholders
to discuss announced financial results, forward-looking guidance, and key strategies.
In FY17, management met with over 90 institutional shareholders representing more
than 70 percent of actively managed Agilent shares. From time to time shareholders will
provide their perspective or recommendations with respect to a spectrum of topics
regarding the general management of the company. Agilent management seriously
considers the input of shareholders when forming strategies and policies.
Additionally, the company seeks out input regarding executive compensation from
its largest shareholders and the proposed compensation of named executive officers

64G4-EC2 Financial Implications and Other Risks and Opportunities for the
Organization’s Activities Due to Climate Change
Agilent integrates climate change into its business strategy in several ways. First,
Agilent uses our ISO14001 environmental management system to monitor and
reduce our environmental impacts from CO2 emissions. Secondly, Agilent recognizes
that having a reputation as an environmental leader is a competitive advantage. This
advantage allows Agilent to attract and retain the best and brightest employees; obtain
and maintain business from other companies who choose suppliers with strong
environmental practices; and attract investors interested in the same. To communicate
our achievements, Agilent participates in many external surveys including Dow Jones
Sustainability Index, CDP, green energy surveys, etc. Our environmental practices and
results are summarized in our annual Corporate Social Responsibility Report. Each year
Agilent implements projects to conserve energy and improve energy efficiency, and thus
reduce GHG emissions. These range from upgrading lighting systems with low con-
sumption alternatives such as LED’s, to more investment-intensive initiatives such as
replacing chiller or boiler plant infrastructure, and the installation of solar photo-voltaic
systems. In addition to focusing on energy conservation, a significant component of
our strategy is to invest in owned renewable energy generation. To date, Agilent has
invested in over 1.5 Megawatts of solar PV power. From a business perspective, these
investments have multiple benefits, from reducing our long-term energy costs and
hedging against future price increases to improving employee morale. We've received
a multitude of positive feedback from our employees regarding Agilent's investment
in renewable energy. From a product perspective, Agilent has set objectives to reduce
energy and solvent use in certain products and we are progressing toward those goals.
We will continue initiatives to build more energy and chemical efficient products.
Supplier selection and procurement decisions are also influenced by climate change
considerations. Since 2004 Agilent has had in place a Supplier Environmental Social
Responsibility (ESR) Code of Conduct against which we evaluate existing and potential
suppliers on factors including adoption of sound environmental practices and
conformance with relevant laws, regulations and international principles. We have
developed a supplier scorecard which includes assessing environmental attributes
of potential suppliers when we make sourcing decisions. For incumbent suppliers,
Agilent conducts occasional audits of suppliers with potential high environmental
impact, identifies the opportunities for improvements and works closely to develop
and execute a corrective action plan.

Agilent After School (AAS) Kit Program (Global Program)
Agilent’s After School program is a series of 24 science experiment kits intended for
hands-on use by children ages 9-13. The kits help students learn physics, biology, earth
sciences, chemistry, and more—and they have been designed as a complete “program
in a box”. The kits include measurement devices and biographies of key inventors or
scientists to add context to the science. Agilent’s program was designed to be
implemented in after-school venues, such as science clubs, community centers,
libraries and other settings outside the classroom, and while AAS supports
international, federal and state science standards, they don’t compete with a
teacher’s curriculum.
AAS kits contain all the materials needed for students to do real-world experiments in
which they build and learn about electronic-circuit games, clean water engineering,
solar cars and thumb pianos (Kalimbas) – just to name a few. Agilent employees
manage and implement this program, working with and mentoring the students. The
program is being implemented in 20 countries and touches 50,000 students around the
world each year.
Canary Foundation
With Agilent and Agilent employee volunteer support in the U.S., the Canary Foundation
in conjunction with the Canary Center at Stanford University, is building a cancer

worldwide. By re-orienting research towards early detection, the Canary Foundation
is making great advances in cancer research.
Science research is focused on a two-prong diagnostic strategy: blood-based
biomarkers and molecular imaging. By discovering blood-based biomarkers or
biological “fingerprints” that show the presence or progress of a disease. These will
identify individuals who are likely to have cancer. These new imaging technologies
will help visualize a cancer type with more sensitivity and specificity but also help to
differentiate benign and malignant disease.

water consumption by 10 percent and 20 percent respectively is monitored quarterly.
Energy use is determined to be Agilent's most significant environmental aspect,
consuming approximately 137,000 MWh (494,000 GJ) in FY17 (this amounts to about
59,000 MT of greenhouse gases). Consumption is primarily from the use of electricity
(indirect) and gas or fuel oil for heating or on-site electricity generation (direct). Energy
consumption is tracked quarterly against targets, and appropriate adjustments are
implemented where possible. Energy consumption is normalized by the operating
footprint (in sq. ft.), by headcount and revenue.
Agilent commissioned over 20 energy and water conservation projects at its major
sites leading to a potential annual energy saving of about 6000 MWh (23000 GJ).
Half of this comes from the replacement of traditional lighting with LED's at a number
of Agilent's large sites which has the potential to reduce global electricity consumption
by nearly 3000 MWh (11000 GJ). Other site projects include new boiler and chiller plant
installations, modifications to air handling plant and other infrastructure modifications.
Globally, these reductions and the continued use of solar photovoltaic generation has
effected a net offset of 4,490 MT of Greenhouse Gas Emissions.
75In FY17, our energy reduction per square foot was 2.38 percent against a target of
3 percent (FY14 baseline). Agilent's energy reduction per site headcount was actually
a massive 14 percent against the same 3 percent target which reflects a significant
headcount increase at some of our sites in response to increased production demand.
Increased production intensity at some sites resulted in an increase in local energy
consumption but globally when factoring in headcount increases, there was a net
reduction in energy use per headcount of 14 percent. FY17 saw a net reduction of
6 percent in consumption per $ annual revenue compared to last year.
Water use is also identified as one of Agilent's globally significant environmental
aspects. Targets to monitor and reduce water usage, where possible, are tracked and
reported on a quarterly basis. In FY17 the water consumption per square foot was
reduced by 9 percent (and by 21 percent by headcount) against the 6 percent target and
is well on track to meet the 20 percent reduction (FY14 baseline) over 10-years.
Waste
Agilent's FY17 waste management plan continued to work towards its target to divert
wastes from landfill.
Agilent was close to its solid waste diversion goal of 90 percent, achieving an overall
diversion rate of 88 percent. The goal of zero hazardous waste to landfill was nearly
met with a diversion rate of 99 percent. The focus for FY18 includes an investigation of
reduction opportunities at the most significant hazardous waste producing sites.
Products and Services
Agilent is committed to designing, manufacturing, and distributing environmentally
responsible products. Environmental aspects are considered in the design,
manufacture, distribution, use, obsolescence, disposal, recovery, and reuse of
Agilent products. Our aim is to minimize the environmental impact of our products and
operations by conforming to applicable regulations and to also proactively implement
more sustainable practices in material selection and use for both product construction
and consumables.
Agilent has developed an Environmental Compliance Framework to sustain and
facilitate compliant product design, development, production, refurbishment, and
support. Additional information on our environmental and social performance can
be found at Agilent’s Commitment to Environment and Social Responsibility
(see https://www.agilent.com/environment/environment.shtml).
Agilent aims to minimize the environmental impact of our products and operations:
• Products are designed to be highly reliable to maximize their useful life.
• Maintenance and repair services extend the useful life of Agilent products.
• Customers benefit from product upgrade, trade-in and trade-up programs. When
a customer no longer requires an Agilent product, we have implemented several
options for reuse, re-manufacture, or take-back based on the product type and
customer location to ensure the product is properly managed.
• Reuse programs are offered for selected products, also addressing requirements
from the European WEEE (waste from electrical and electronic equipment)
Directive.
76Specific FY17 achievements include:
• 100 percent of new and existing product conversions for the EU market are ROHS
compliant.
• Product changes to reduce REACH registration requirements from 5 to 3
substances.
Agilent contributes to the environment and sustainability not only by reducing the
impact of its own products, but also by using its products to measure, analyze and
mitigate the impact of chemicals in the environment. Agilent instruments can perform
more than 800 different analytical applications and tests related to the environment.
Other examples of such contribution are listed below:
Detecting Pollutants in Air: An Agilent GC/MS with Agilent deconvolution reporting
software can screen for 171 volatile organic air pollutants within minutes.
Detecting Pollutants in Water: Agilent is working closely with customers to better
identify and address the problem of pharmaceuticals and personal-care products like
perfumes and cosmetics being present in water and the environment.
Making Children’s Toys Safer: Phthalates are plasticizers used by manufacturers to
make plastics more flexible, durable and softer. The U.S. Consumer Product Safety
Commission limits their use in toys and child-care products. With Agilent FTIR
analyzers and exclusive calibrated methods, laboratories can rapidly screen large
numbers of parts and objects for phthalate content with little or no sample preparation.
With the portable Agilent 4500 Series FTIR and the newly developed 4500 Polymer ID
Package, labs can determine the chemical composition of a polymer in seconds.
Keeping Dioxins Out of Food: Agilent has developed a new method for dioxin analysis.
Dioxins and dioxin-like compounds have been linked to developmental problems,
immune system damage and cancer. These toxic compounds can be released into
the environment during industrial processes such as metallurgy, cement production,
pesticide manufacturing and waste incineration. Regulations in Europe, the United
States and other countries require that food samples should be tested to detect dioxins
and dioxin-like compounds at very low levels.
Combatting Dangers of Lead Poisoning: Exposure to lead can be toxic to humans.
There is no known "safe threshold" of lead in the body, where it will not cause harm.
Using Agilent equipment, U.S. researchers have developed a method for detecting
heavy metals in urine by collecting metal-bound nanoparticles, and researchers in
China have developed a novel method for measuring trace amounts of lead in
environmental water and vegetable samples.

GHG emission reduction initiatives include site infrastructure projects to replace heating
and ventilation equipment as well as the continued use of on-site solar PV installations.
Annualized reductions are theoretical based on the predicted reduction in electricity
usage as a direct result of over 20 energy saving projects in FY17. The 6,000 MWh or
23,000 GJ (3,500 MT GHGe) is the total expected annualized reduction in usage and
not the actual total realized in FY17 as these projects were completed over the duration
of FY17.
Globally, 3 on-site solar PV systems amounting to a net offset of 1,800 MWh (6,500 GJ)
and 990 MT GHGe (actual).
The greenhouse gas emissions reduction to be achieved from projects during the
reporting period as a direct result of the initiatives is 4,490 MT CO2e. This Scope 2
CO2e reduction is made up of 3,500MT from projects and 990 MT from on-site solar PV
generation.
G4-EN20 Emissions of Ozone-Depleting Substances

86G4-EN27 Initiatives to Mitigate Environmental Impacts of Products and Services, and
Extent of Impact Mitigation
Agilent Technologies is committed under our corporate citizenship program to conduct
business in an ethical, socially responsible and environmentally sustainable manner.
The General Specification for the Environment (GSE) must be followed by all our
suppliers. As a new initiative it has been decided to update the GSE twice a year to
strengthen the phaseout of all Substances of Very High Concern (SVHC) in our
products wherever possible. Our Design for the Environment Guidelines is used to help
minimize the environmental impacts of product packaging. Agilent Technologies has
a RoHS and WEEE Program with close contact to suppliers to meet the legal
requirements for restriction of hazardous substances and expectations from our
customers.
Agilent is working to improve the energy efficiency of selected products/product
families including instruments with high energy consumption.
Initiatives to mitigate the most significant environmental impacts of products/service
groups:
• Agilent’s Supplier Code of Conduct Policy ensures compliance with Environmental,
Health, Safety, and Social Responsibility (EHSSR) guidelines throughout our supply
chain. Our suppliers are also accountable for ensuring that their subcontractors
comply with Agilent’s EHSSR guidelines, with the responsibility for taking corrective
action as necessary.
• Agilent implemented due diligence practices following the EICC standard to meet
requirements of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection
Act commonly known as conflict minerals. Agilent met the annual reporting
requirements of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in 2014. Agilent’s
Supplier Code of Conduct Policy was updated to include the expectation that
“suppliers shall take reasonable measures to ensure that products, parts,
components and materials supplied to Agilent are DRC (Democratic Republic
of Congo) conflict free” as that term under Section 1502 of the Dodd-Frank Act.
• Agilent continued robust communication of its General Specification for the
Environment (GSE) with its strategic suppliers. This effort enables Agilent and its
suppliers to comply with major environmental regulations on material use, product
packaging and labeling. Agilent’s two strategies to drive restricted substance
elimination are:
• Communication of our GSE restrictions to our product designers and suppliers
• Verification that selected suppliers meet Agilent’s GSE requirements
87G4-EN28 Percentage of Products Sold and Their Packaging Materials That Are
Reclaimed by Category
Agilent’s Remarketing Solutions Division is dedicated to recovering older instruments
for the purpose of resale. For a certain segment of our customers (start-ups, academics,
etc.), these pre-owned instruments offer a competitively priced alternative to buying
a new instrument. As a company, we are using fewer environmental resources to
manufacture new products to meet this customer demand. For more detail, see
Premium Refurbished Instruments.

Occupational Health and Safety
Agilent Technologies operates under a company-wide environmental, health and
safety management system (EHSMS) that applies to Agilent design, development,
manufacturing, distribution, and sales and service operations worldwide. The purpose
of Agilent's EHSMS is to implement the Environmental Health and Safety Policy. The
EHSMS provides a framework for Agilent's business operations to make decisions
regarding their environmental and Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) activities in
response to changing internal and external factors. The EHSMS is supported by key
processes focused on planning, implementation and operation, checking and corrective
action, and management review.
92Agilent reviews its OHS aspects annually. Each region conducts their own local reviews
and these are consolidated into a Global OHS aspects and impacts register. Those OHS
aspects that attain the highest (risk) scores are either assigned objectives and targets
for the current year or, if they are business fundamentals, will have associated
programs established to ensure compliance and implementation of risk-based
management approaches. Performance related to these objectives and programs are
monitored and reported to senior management at least quarterly, and are identified in
quarterly business reviews. Formal Management Reviews are held twice annually to
report current OHS performance to senior management. Any deviations from target are
noted, and corrective actions or changes to strategies are identified for approval.
Training and Education
At Agilent, employees develop individually and collectively to enhance their skills and
knowledge, to achieve current business objectives, and prepare for the challenge of
future business objectives. Development is a key lever to achieve the organizational
capability that Agilent needs for current and future growth and success.
Employee development at Agilent is a collaborative process between a manager and an
employee. Agilent managers are accountable for assessing employee performance on
behalf of the company and supporting the development of employees over time.
The following approaches to employee development are used at Agilent, and are
provided based on business need. We recommend employees choose a blend of
learning approaches that feature employees learning while doing their day-to-day jobs.
• Work Assignments: Challenging jobs, special assignments, project initiatives, and
job rotations. Every work assignment is a potential development experience.
• Learning from Others: Coaching, mentoring, and networking with internal and
external people with experience or expertise.
• Training/learning: Specific technical and business skill development provided
internally by Agilent or externally by qualified educational institutions via a
classroom, online, or self-study format.
• Develop a sponsor, mentor, coaching relationship: Internal top performers have
found that informal mentoring or sponsoring relationships are very helpful.
• Increase visibility/network: Look for opportunities to attend meetings in other
parts of the organization. Request stretch assignments, projects that provide a
new perspective on work and collaborative opportunities in other parts of the
organization.

uncompromising integrity and will not tolerate corrupt activities of any kind. Agilent
prohibits promising, offering, giving to, or receiving from, any individual anything of

customers and government employees.
In dealing with any government investigators, employees are instructed to follow the

• If government investigators contact or visit an Agilent site, never resist or obstruct
the investigation or adopt a defensive attitude. Immediately contact the most
senior site manager, the country general manager, and a representative of the
Legal Department.
• If you choose to speak with government investigators, always speak truthfully and
completely. Never conceal, destroy or remove any documents or other information
to avoid detection during an investigation.

Employees are trained through both computer-based and live trainings on competition
law on an annual basis and as needed. Employees are trained to report any evidence of
misconduct directly to the Legal Department or via the Compliance Hotline.
113Compliance
Our compliance and ethics program has its roots in our Standards of Business Conduct,
which has governed employee behavior since Agilent was part of HP. Our commitment
to ethics and compliance begins at the highest levels of the company. The program is

Counsel and has a reporting relationship to the Audit & Finance Committee of the Board
of Directors. The CCO is supported by a team of direct reports located in all major

Agilent’s Business Management System
Agilent’s Business Management System (BMS) is designed to support our business
groups, so that Agilent products, services, and interactions consistently and effectively
meet customer expectations and applicable regulatory requirements, and provide a
mechanism for continual improvement.
The Agilent BMS provides a framework from which business groups and operations
can make decisions appropriate to their specific business, customer and geographic
needs while ensuring that applicable minimum standards are met, and describes the
minimum standards and the required processes for the business groups’ business
management systems that are designed to conform to ISO 9001:2008. Each business
group maintains a business management system to illustrate its specific required
processes for meeting customer expectations and, where applicable, other standards
such as ISO14001, ISO/IEC 17025, AS 9100, ISO 13485, or TL 9000. Agilent’s
infrastructure organizations provide centrally managed, business critical services
and operate as internal service suppliers to the business groups.

employee’s privacy is paramount to the Agilent philosophy of respecting the individual.
For customers, we recognize that building a long-term business relationship with them
depends a great deal on trust. This trust begins with our commitment to respecting as
well as protecting their personal information. The key to providing an adequate level of
privacy is the business-wide implementation of an effective internal Privacy Program.
The program must address the legal and ethical issues regarding personal employee
