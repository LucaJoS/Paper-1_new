Home (/) About Agilent (/about/) Working with Agilent (/about/workingwa/) Environmental Policy & Social Responsibility (/environment/environment.shtml)
Agilent Technologies operates under a
ISO 14001 and EHS Management System
company-wide environmental, health
and safety management system
(EHSMS) that applies to Agilent design,
development, manufacturing,
distribution, and sales and service
operations worldwide. The purpose of
Agilent's EHSMS is to implement the
Environmental Health and Safety Policy (http://www.agilent.com/environment/Agilent_EHS_Policy.pdf). The EHSMS provides a framework for Agilent's business
operations to make decisions regarding their environmental and OHS activities in response to changing internal and external factors. The EHSMS is supported by
key processes focused on planning, implementation and operation, checking and corrective action, and management review.
Agilent achieved ISO 14001 registration (/environment/env_ISO14001_certificate.pdf) of our company-wide EHSMS and our manufacturing sites under a single
certificate in April 2001. Our single certificate enables us to more efficiently conduct the independent audits required to register and maintain certification at our
manufacturing sites.
ISO 14001 is a voluntary international standard and registration is recognized internationally as demonstration that a company is effective in managing its impact
on the environment. The registration is granted by third party reviewers under guidelines administered by ISO. The standard is consistent with the concept of
sustainable development and stresses continual improvement.
Agilent's EHSMS has been implemented at R&D facilities and other large non-production facilities. These sites are not included in our ISO14001 registration.
