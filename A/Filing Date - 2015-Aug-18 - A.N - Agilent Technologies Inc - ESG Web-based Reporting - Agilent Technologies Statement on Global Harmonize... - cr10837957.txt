Agilent Technologies Statement on Global Harmonized System (GHS) Compliance
Agilent Technologies is committed to protecting health and the environment by ensuring the safety of its products
throughout their lifecycles. As part of that commitment, Safety Data Sheets (SDS) are provided for hazardous
chemical-biological products.
Agilent Technologies is on track to comply with all Global Harmonized System (GHS) regulations for chemical
labeling in order to meet implementation timelines in each country. This change will not affect product
composition or quality in any way. As of May 2015, you will begin to see updated labeling in shipments you
receive from Agilent Technologies. Over the next several months, these updates will be complete across all of the
required product lines.
During this transition you can find country specific GHS compliant SDS online at
http://www.chem.agilent.com/en-US/search/library/Pages/MSDSSearch.aspx for complete information on all
potential hazards.
If you cannot find a SDS you are looking for, or have any questions about product labeling, please contact us at
contact_us@agilent.com or +1 877-424-4536 so we can assist you.
