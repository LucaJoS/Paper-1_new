who took advantage of the company’s
Volunteer Time Off benefit in 2018. Last
August, he packed his bags and headed
for Turkana, Kenya, where he taught math
in a Cooperation Project in Saint Patrick’s
Nomadic Girls Center.
Each year, approximately 60 orphaned girls, ages 3-20, live in the
Center for the month. On weekday mornings, the students study with
their teachers and in the afternoons, they make bracelets and baskets.
Weekends are fun-filled as volunteers accompany the children to sports
events, dance competitions and outings to Turkana Lake.
“Volunteering at the Nomadic Girls Center was a very great experience
for me. I learned a lot about the Turkana people and their way of life.
The girls speak very good English so communication was fantastic,”
said Parreño. “Our labor during this month is just a small grain of sand,
but I hope it helps to motivate these children for the rest of the year.”
The Agilent Volunteer Time Off program allows eligible employees to
take up to six days of paid time off each year for volunteer activities
with charities and organizations that align with program guidelines.

In recent history, rice consumption has travelled
far beyond Asian countries to become the fastest-
growing food staple in Africa – and unscrupulous
people are taking advantage of this massive
business opportunity.
70 77112018 CSR REPORT
Under the leadership of international food fraud expert
Professor Chris Elliott, Director of the Institute for
Global Food Security at Queens University, Belfast, the
global Fingerprinting Rice team was established to
tackle some of these issues.
Their first goal was to create a system to monitor and
manage fraudulent rice. They hoped to find a way
to “fingerprint” premium quality rice so it could be
easily identified in the marketplace as safe. Ideally,
consumers could watch the rice being tested and know
they were buying clean food.
“But back in 2015 and 2017, It took a long time to
determine the difference between an authentic rice and
an adulterated rice,” said Dr. Ernest Teye, professor in
the Department of Agricultural Engineering, University
of Cape Coast, Ghana. “We needed to find a way to
quickly identify good rice.”
The Agilent Foundation provided a grant to support
this critical research.

THE PLAN TO FIGHT FOOD FRAUD
The team agreed that a rapid screening approach that
would work in the field was critical, and that hand-held
molecular spectroscopy was a good option. At the
same time, they worked on developing an extensive
library of molecular fingerprints using thousands of rice
samples from China, India, Ghana and Vietnam. The rice
fingerprints could be stored in the digital cloud, ready to
access during rice testing.
It was a
practical plan.
In moments, samples could be
matched if the rice was good.
7744 77552018 CSR REPORT
TEACHING THOSE WHO TEACH AND REACH OTHERS
With technology identified and a testing system in
place, the team has been sharing their learnings.
The two-year initiative is nearing completion, and
team members from China, Vietnam and Ghana
have been scheduling and conducting international
and in-country workshops for stakeholders, and
staff and students at their Universities.
The team has also identified biomarkers of authentic rice and intends to drive the biomarkers
into the development of new standard test methods at the ISO standards level.
And of course, they are all working to support
continued rice testing in their marketplaces.
“We are bringing food analysis into the kitchen, to inform people about the quality of rice,” said
Teye. “We are now overcoming the problems of toxic rice. We have a simple, rapid robotic
detection method and the necessary identifying biomarkers for good rice. Together, this will
save a lot of lives. That’s a good solution for all.”
